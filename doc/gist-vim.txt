TIPS                                                           *gist-vim-tips*

If you set "g:gist_clip_command", gist.vim will copy the gist code with option
"-c".

  - Mac: >
    let g:gist_clip_command = 'pbcopy'
<
  - Linux: >
    let g:gist_clip_command = 'xclip -selection clipboard'
<
  - Others (cygwin?): >
    let g:gist_clip_command = 'putclip'
<
If you want to detect filetype from the filename: >

    let g:gist_detect_filetype = 1
<
If you want to open the browser after the post: >

    let g:gist_open_browser_after_post = 1
<
If you want to change the browser: >

    let g:gist_browser_command = 'w3m %URL%'
<
or: >

    let g:gist_browser_command = 'opera %URL% &'
<
On windows, this should work with your user settings.

If you want to show your private gists with ":Gist -l": >

    let g:gist_show_privates = 1
<
If you want to edit all files for gists containing more than one: >

    let g:gist_get_multiplefile = 1
<

If you want to update a gist, embed >

This plugin uses github API v3. Setting value is stored in `~/.gist.vim`.
gist-vim have two ways to access APIs.

|BasicAuth|

  Require github user ID and password. This is easy but not secure.
  You need to set global git config:
>
    $ git config --global github.user Username
<
  If you want to use password written in ~/.gitconfig like below:
>
    [github]
        password = xxxxx
<
  Add following into your ~/.vimrc
>
    let g:gist_use_password_in_gitconfig = 1
<
|OAuth2|

 1. Register your application.

   Note that you must set `Callback URL` as same as following.

   https://github.com/settings/applications/new

   fill like following

   Callback URL should be http://mattn.github.com/gist-vim
   If you don't want to point this site, use URL parameter 'code' as PIN.

  2. If you haven't already set up your github user in .gitconfig:
>
    $ git config --global github.user Username
<

  3. Start `:Gist -l`

    You'll see some prompts. fill ClientID/CilentSecret. Then you can see
    browser show up.
    If you set Callback URL above, you can see PIN code.
    Copy this value and paste to prompt `PIN:`.
